# jadin.me
My personal website, powered by [hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

## Notes
For cloning including the theme, we need to also grab submodules:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TaylorJadin/jadin.me.git
```

## To Do
 - [] Implement light theme
 - [] Make about me page, include light portfolio and link to resume
 - [] Make workflow for short posts / link posts
 - [] Integrate / Make workflow for podcast episodes + youtube uploads??
