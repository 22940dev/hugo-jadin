This semester I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to teach a tutorial class with 10 honors students on Digital Citizenship. Here is my course site: [digciz.jadin.me](https://t.co/kecwvKvOx1?amp=1)

The course is best described as a small sampling of a few digital citizenship topics and a project where students design and build a website on [Knight Domains](https://knight.domains) for their own personal use. We meet once a week for 5 weeks, then we have a mid-semester check-in, then a end of semester website showcase! For the project,I sat down with all of them to help define the wants / needs / purpose of their site, and those criteria become the assessment criteria for their particular project.

On top of that, [digciz.jadin.me](https://t.co/kecwvKvOx1?amp=1) itself is a bit of an experiment for me. I built it using Grav, using the Open matter Course Hub package. The content on the site itself is [available on my GitHub](https://github.com/TaylorJadin/digciz-honors-tutorial/) for easy re-use by others.

Honestly there isn’t probably a ton that others would want to re-use here yet, as the site is pretty bare-bones. I typically use the site as a jumping off point for my students to get easy access to any materials, but I also use it as an in-class presentation tool instead of PowerPoint / Google Slides.
