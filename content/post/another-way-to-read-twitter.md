title: Another way to read Twitter
---


For a while now I have been focusing on shifting more of my reading time away from Twitter, and towards RSS. I actually [wrote about this a few months ago](https://jadin.me/digid-and-media-consumption/) during #DigPINS identity week in regards to not only WHAT I read affecting me, but HOW I read it. When I wrote that post I was using a self-hosted RSS reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, which I had set up on a subdomain off of this very site. I still mostly like Tiny Tiny RSS and the customizability it offers, but I have since moved over to FeedBin for its [Twitter integration](https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/01/11/feedbin-is-the-best-way-to-read-twitter/). If you are interested in a showcase of how I use FeedBin as a tool, skip to the "[How does shoving Tweets into an rss reader help?](#why-rss)" section below. If you are here for the long haul this next bit will go in to a little bit of why I do this and what problems it solves.

Before we get in the weeds to much (and don't worry I will, as I always do) if you are unfamiliar with what RSS or an RSS reader is you should first read these excellent posts from [Joe Murphy](https://kenyon.digpins.org/week-2-posts/joes-tech-tip-tracking-blogs/) and [Alan Levine](https://cogdogblog.com/2018/06/indispensable-feed-reader-activity/) first.

## Wait, didn't you just say you were cutting back on Twitter reading time?

It is important for me to reiterate how I use Twitter, and why I am trying to cut back my time spent on twitter.com and their official Twitter app. Twitter is valuable to me for a few reasons:

1. I use it professionally to learn from, listen to, and grow my [PLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network).
2. I use it to keep up with news (I am a bit of a tech news junkie).
3. I also use it to stay connected with a small group of my closest friends, mostly ones from college.

I do follow quite a few accounts, but I am choosy about who gets a follow in order to not allow a lot of negativity come across my timeline, but more importantly I spend much more time reading tweets on hashtags and lists that I (and others) create. I have a private list called "Priority" that has a handful of accounts that I read almost everything they tweet (when I have the time, I'm a new dad so recently I don't have the time). As far as hashtags go I read most tweets that come through on a few hashtags, mainly [#DoOO](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23DoOO&src=savs), [#DigPINS](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23DigPINS&src=savs), [#DigCiz](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23DigCiz&src=savs), and [#IndieWeb](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23indieweb&src=savs).

So this is all a long-winded way to say, I don't spend much time reading my timeline, I mostly a couple lists and a few hashtags AND I like to read (or at least be aware of) almost every tweet that comes across those channels. Unfortunately Twitter's website and official apps make this very difficult, they make it clunky and slow to see the latest tweets on a given hashtag, they bury the option to get to your lists, and they don't keep a record of what you have or have not read.

The problem here is that Twitter does not want me to use their service in this way, they don't want me to have tools that easily allow me to see what I have and have not read, they would prefer that I come back to their app or website multiple times a day to check for Tweets, instead of allowing them to come to me in a pseudo-inbox. The more times I visit their site, the more times they can serve up ads to me. I have found that I am very susceptible to this behavior patterns that encourage you to revisit an app or website often (the [Data Detox Kit](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home) calls this "the twitch"[^1]) I don't like that my brain sometimes falls into those patterns, so I want to change how I use Twitter to suit my needs better.

Twitter power-users out there are probably screaming in their heads at this point "OMG Taylor just use TweetDeck." [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) is a great option for lots of people but it doesn't solve my main complaint from above; it doesn't save my reading position so I don't know what I have already read. It also doesn't get rid of "the Twitch!"
