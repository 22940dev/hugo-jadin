### UPDATE
We are no longer going to be holding this event on a regular basis. Instead I recommend you stop by [Tech Bar](https://techbar.knight.domains) to scratch your diy-website-building itch!

--------------

We have a budding [Domain of One's Own](https://knight.domains/) project at St. Norbert College, and it has been exciting to see our pilot groups and [Tech Bar](https://www.snc.edu/its/services/techbar.html) students jump head-first into building their own slices of the web and taking control of their digital identities! Despite all of this excitement, a sentiment we hear again and again from our students, staff, and faculty is that they often have a hard time setting aside time to work on their domains, and they feel like they need a little extra push or encouragement to get to work.

Our idea to solve this was to create a "space" that encourages those of us with domains to work alongside each other physically or virtually. We are calling this **Open Domains Lab**.

## Open Domains Lab has three components:

#### 1. A dedicated time to work on your domain/website:
The first Thursday of the month, every month, from 4 pm to 7 pm CT.

#### 2. A physical space to work alongside others:
We will meet in the lower level of the [Cassandra Voss Center](https://www.snc.edu/cvc/). In this space, people will work together on their domains and websites. Everyone is welcome!

The Cassandra Voss Center also has a kitchen and easy to access visitor parking via [lots P14 and P11](http://www.snc.edu/parking/docs/parkingmap.pdf).

#### 3. A virtual space to work alongside others:
If you can't make it to campus, or if you prefer working alone, that is OK! Tweet using [#DoOO](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23DoOO&src=typd) during Open Domains Lab (first Thursday of the month, every month, from 4 pm to 7 pm CT) and ask questions, get advice, or share your work!
